I’m not sure why I was suspicious of it  going in, perhaps because it was totally new. Or maybe because the word database doesn’t sound particularly thrilling. It’s actually really fun, in part because there’s such instant gratification when you send a working query off request and get back the results you were hoping for.</p><hr><p>As I mentioned in my previous post, I have a problem with pacingmyself. Partly, it’s a product of enjoying learning, programming, andlearning about programming. However, the further I get into the course the more I’ve started to suspect that there’s something more to my inability to switch off. More than once I’ve found until my head hurts and well beyond the point of enjoyment. I’ve decided that this part of my obsessiveness comes from a deep seated need to be the best.</p><p>The thing is, this ‘best’ really has very little to do with anyone else’s abilities: I’m not particularly interested in being better than anyone (shine theory, y’all. It has more to do with a nebulous standard that relates specifically to myself. It’s one which changes daily and is, of course, always out of reach. Week five was project week, which unleashed the full force of this not so useful feeling. I had an image of where I wanted to get to in seven days and self flagellated when I thought I wasn’t going to make it, without stopping to consider whether or not my plans were realistic in the first place.</p><p>At the moment I simultaneously think I’m doing fairly well and also worry that I’m not doing as well as I should be. Who defined this ‘should be’? Not my instructors, not my classmates. Certainly not me. This ‘should be’, or ‘best’, it doesn’t exist. Pacing myself turns out not to be a simple matter of taking a break, going for a walk, knitting a hat or playing a game. I think I’m going to have to figure out how to give myself some credit.</p></main></article><section class="social-container  astro-dxYczTA0"><a href="https://github.com/ktweeden" class="astro-dxYczTA0"><i class="fab fa-github astro-dxYczTA0"></i></a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ktweeden/" class="astro-dxYczTA0"><i class="fab fa-linkedin astro-dxYczTA0"></i></a><a href="https://twitter.com/ktweeden" class="astro-dxYczTA0"><i class="fab fa-twitter astro-dxYczTA0"></i></a><a href="https://www.instagram.com/kate_l_preston/" class="astro-dxYczTA0"><i class="fab fa-instagram astro-dxYczTA0"></i></a></section></body></html>
